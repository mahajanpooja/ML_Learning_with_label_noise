# ML_Learning_with_label_noise
Built a transition matrix estimator and two classification algorithms that are robust to label noise.

The objective of this assignment is to build a transition matrix estimator and two classification algorithms that are robust to label noise.
Three input datasets are given. For each dataset, the training and validation data contains class-conditional random label noise, whereas the test data is clean. You need to build at least two di erent classi ers trained and validated on the noisy data, which can have a good classi cation accuracy on the clean test data. You are required to compare the robustness of the two algorithms to label noise. For the first two datasets, the transition matrices are provided. You can directly use the given transition matrices for designing classi ers that are robust to label
noise. For the last dataset, the transition matrix is not provided. You are required to build a transition matrix estimator to estimate the transition matrix. Then, employ your estimated transition matrix for classi cation. Your estimated transition matrix must be included in your final report. Note that to validate the effectiveness of your transition matrix estimator, you could use your estimator on the first two datasets and compare your estimation to the given transition matrices. Data prepossessing is allowed, but please remember to clarify and justify it in the report carefully.
